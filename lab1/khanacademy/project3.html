        <p>Today, I began my journey into programming! It feels both exciting and overwhelming at the same time. I’ve started with HTML, learning about how web pages are structured using tags. The first thing I created was a simple webpage with headings and paragraphs, and it made me realize how much there is to learn in this field. But I’m excited to continue learning and improving every day!</p>

        <p class="post-date">Posted on January 10, 2025</p>
        <p>After getting comfortable with HTML, I moved on to CSS, which allows me to style my web pages and make them look much more interesting. I learned how to change fonts, colors, and even add layouts! I’m also practicing creating navigation links and styling them. I’ve added borders, margins, and padding to elements, and I can’t wait to dive deeper into more advanced CSS features. This is definitely a rewarding experience!</p>
